Text editor - help you to write code faster

vscode

HTML

write in lowercase with no spaces e.g. folder should be named project1. If you upload to a linux web server it recognises lower case.
If you put spaces it will put random letters in e.g. %20

File every web server looks for and it is named index. If you want to change that you need to edit your web server. Say you didnt like the name index then you would change it

Elements and tags

HTML to display content. CSS to display styling. Javascript to change behaviour

Elements are designators that define structure of html file

Element called P for paragraph. If there is an img the element is called img. If there is a heading there are elements all the way from h1-h6


HTML Tags	HTML Elements	HTML Attributes
HTML tag starts with < and ends with >	Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements.	HTML attributes are found only in the starting tag.

href is an attribute - properties that provide additional info about the element

property="value" e.g. href="www.google.com"

This tells the browser this is file is html file <!DOCTYPE html>
What language it will be <html lang="en">

Every html file is broken in to two parts <head> and <body>

Nesting is elements written inside other elements

Github - cloud storage for code and share it. Used for collaboration

CSS

tags become selectors E.G. h1{
			color:red;
			font: 12
			
inline style
